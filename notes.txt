  keep them on display post mouseover? or only for a short
  time? Or for an extended duration that slowly covers it again
- METHOD: display a cover over each name. on mouse over remove.
  on mouseoff recover to make it so the mouse must stay there.
  so immediate mouseoff hides the name again.
- STYLING: quick reveal animation, like peeling
  off a barcode sticker from a purchase. maybe make the stickers
  100% larger than the name on the page, and give each sticker
  a slight offset. If poss leave some sticker remenance around the name.
